## [**Creating a new post**](https://keystatic.com/docs/installation-next-js#creating-a-new-post)

In our Keystatic config file, we've set the&nbsp;`path`&nbsp;property for our&nbsp;`posts`&nbsp;collection to&nbsp;`src/content/posts/*`.

As a result, creating a new post from the Keystatic Admin UI should create a new&nbsp;`content`&nbsp;directory in the&nbsp;`src`&nbsp;directory, with the new post&nbsp;`.mdoc`&nbsp;file inside!

Go ahead — create a new post from the Admin UI, and hit save.

You will find your new post inside the&nbsp;`src/content/posts`&nbsp;directory:

```
src
└── content
    └── posts
        └── my-first-post.mdoc
```

Navigate to that file in your code editor and verify that you can see the Markdown content you entered. For example:

```
---
title: My First Post
---

This is my very first post. I am **super** excited.
```
